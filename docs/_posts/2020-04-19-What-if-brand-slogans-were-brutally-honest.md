Brand slogans in many ways are mini-mission statements. They’re an audible form of advertising. No wonder, the world knows what a “Just Do It” or a “I’m Lovin’ it” refers to.

Often, unknowingly, famous companies sway away from their actual goal or their target audience does for reasons beyond control(like today, when we’re sheltering in place). This makes their actual slogans feel out of context.

Let’s look at some of the popular company slogans and how a little tweak makes them more relevant today. The outcome might not be a pleasant one, but it’ll make you chuckle, hopefully.

Actual: “Never settle”   
Honest: The price keeps increasing.

Honest: Except the price, it’s identically unique.
