#### She might be a little clingy but would surely be great with kids

***

Most of us today are closer to Netflix than people in real life. And as we find ourselves sheltered in place, our relationship with Netflix has only grown. Even if the connection isn’t that strong in the beginning or when you try to take things forward quickly.

A person can only wonder what would happen if their better half starts behaving like Netflix one day. Or rather, if she’s your girlfriend, she’d do the following things(note: can be a boyfriend too).

#### 1\. She’ll be a high maintenance

Though she’s isn’t demanding and is fine with simple dinner dates but you know she’s high maintenance. She cares a lot about her appearance and to make her feel the best, you’d have to buy her premium gifts. And also pamper her with money at the end of each month just to ensure she doesn’t ghost.

#### 2\. She’ll confuse you with too many ideas

Undoubtedly, she’s the best vacation planner. Yes, she’ll throw so many weekend getaway ideas and you wouldn’t even complain because they all seem so exciting. But then you’d be a tad bit confused at where to start and end up not going anywhere. Sometimes, you’d wish she came up with a small list of quality plans only.

#### 3\. It might be embarrassing to introduce her to your family

True, she’s clingy, hard to resist, and keeps you up all night. Even your parents find her cute and might think she’ll be good with kids too. But introducing her to your family might not be a good idea as her words have no filter. You never know, she might just give away your recently watched history and it could feel embarrassing in front of a whole family.

#### 4\. Certainly don’t take her along to your friend’s party

She’s so addictive that even your friends would be in awe of her. But taking her over to a friend’s hang out party would not be in your best interests because you never know whom she’s hanging out with. You introduce her to your bestie and he let’s five more friends meet her. So many guys taking her for rounds and you’d wonder why she isn’t turned on.

#### 5\. She might turn into a stalker after breaking up

Breakups aren’t easy and when Netflix becomes your ex, it’ll get even more difficult to move on. You might be chilling with YouTube and she’ll pop up in front of you. She would start spamming your mail and urge you to get back with some new offerings and conditions. And she already knows a little too much about your likes and dislikes so you’d let it slide because on the rare occasion when she’s in form, it’s such a delight.
