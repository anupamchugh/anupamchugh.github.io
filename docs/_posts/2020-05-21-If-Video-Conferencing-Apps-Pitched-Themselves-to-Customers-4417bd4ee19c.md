#### You have to decide which is the best fit for the job

Video conferencing apps are on the rise as people seek the easiest way to communicate for work and personal reasons. As the demand continues to increase a slew of new apps are joining the fray. From a distance, this might look like a Cinematic App Universe where each of them is vying for more screen time. However, eventually, there will only be one winner. We can only wonder what might happen when these apps start pitching themselves to customers like employees for employers.

#### Skype

I’m so old that I can even recall my previous work experiences. Largely, I’ve been loyal to all my previous employers but they kept complaining about my shrill voice. I’ll work on soft skills and avoid sending spam messages. Once you hire me, of course.

#### FaceTime

It might sound conceited to say but I’m the best security guy world has ever seen. Except for that one time when my ego took over and I started overhearing everyone. However, that’s in the past! I’ll work for free without stealing any data. I just all of my supplies to be official Apple products and a “windowless” room in every sense of the word.

#### Google Meet

True, my family background isn’t the greatest. My brother _Duo_ was caught copying _FaceTime_ in your interviews and was rejected immediately. Since then, my parents kept rebranding me to look more like my sister _Hangouts_. Please, we’re in a recession and I’m ready to work as an intern without any stipend for a few months. Would you let go of my past and hire me?

#### Houseparty

I’ve been a human resource specialist for over three years now but employers started taking me seriously only recently. I won’t waste your time, because I know your firm desperately needs me, after what that stalker guy did. Heads up! I love conducting trivia games and wouldn’t throw legal clauses if you invaded my office without knocking.

#### Zoom

There’s no need to introduce myself anymore. The whole world knows my background. I’ve been fired from my previous jobs. Don’t get me wrong, gathering private data was never the intention and I was only learning. Gosh, I didn’t even know people were getting zoom-bombed. But I’m not a jack of all trades, unlike other candidates who’re busy doing multiple jobs. Despite efforts to eliminate me, I’m still going strong and will only get better from here. Please give me another chance.

#### Facebook Messenger Rooms

I’m a fresher college dropout robot but you might have known me for a while now. Father Mark keeps resurrecting me every few years. First, dad introduced me as [_Rooms_](https://www.macworld.com/article/3012463/facebook-kills-its-creative-labs-responsible-for-apps-that-failed-against-snapchat.html) and I never got a job. Then he rebranded me as [_Bonfire_](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/3/18528317/facebook-bonfire-shutdown-group-video-chat-houseparty-clone) and I turned into ashes. Today, he’s just ripped-off the brains of _Zoom_ and _Houseparty_ to build me. I offer a lifetime of services as complimentary, only if you would hand over all your data for free.
