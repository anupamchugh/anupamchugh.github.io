#### You’d be confused whose the winner as they’d all self-disappear

The Snapchat-like stories feature has become an integral part of every social media app today. All of them have introduced their own self-disappearing stories. A feature that was unique to an emerging Silicon Valley startup once is now the primary form of communication across social media platforms. Predictably all of them are vying for more screen time.

In an alternate world, where apps talk, a private meeting was held. All the prominent social media giants like Snapchat, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram were present. Zuckerberg gave the meeting a miss as Facebook’s stories feature is still struggling to make a mark.

Regardless, there was a war of words. Each of the apps tried to portray how their “Stories” feature is better and different from the others. But the jury couldn’t pick a winner in the end as they all disappeared.

#### Snapchat Stories

We know our birth was an accident. Our developers didn’t even know how to save messages permanently. Nevertheless, we are the originals and oldest amongst you all. Please give us respect.

#### Instagram Stories

Oh please, Snap! My father admired you and would have happily adopted. But you turned him down twice. You surely would have got richer today only if you were his child and I, probably wouldn’t have existed. I’m not ashamed of admitting that I’m your clone. But I’m bigger and better today.

#### YouTube Stories

Some of you might not know but we’ve been around for a while now. To garner attention, we tried spamming users with stories they hadn’t subscribed to. I know you must be hating us as we’re available for the elite only. But we’re kind and don’t ghost if you’re caught up someday. We stay alive for a week and would continue to do so.

#### LinkedIn Stories

We came into existence because the rich YouTubers had started hijacking our platform. Some of them made our platform a stand up comedy show. But we aren’t here to compete with them. Instead, we’ll strive to make the job hunt experience as it’s in real. By ensuring that the job posts you’ve set high hopes on, only disappear daily.

#### Twitter Fleets

Don’t judge me by my age. Though I’m a newborn but still here to stay. My origins shouldn’t be attributed to peer pressure. OK, my parents gave a lot of thoughts for my name but it was only to look different. Trust me, I’ll make the world a much better place than you all. I won’t let anyone get anxiety by the number of likes and retweets. Neither would I need to fact check Trump’s fleets. Perhaps he wouldn’t write only as he needs to archive mandatorily. But I’ll ensure he vanishes quickly.

Thanks for reading.
