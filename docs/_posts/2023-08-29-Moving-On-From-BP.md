In my [announcement post on Medium](https://betterprogramming.pub/better-programming-has-a-new-editor-4f4ee04fa899){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, I shared the news about stepping down from Better Programming after working for 2.5 years and publishing some of the most comprehensive newsletters.

Collaborating and managing thousands of engineering-focused writers across the globe to grow the second-biggest programming publication has been one of the proudest accomplishments of my career. The role gave me the opportunity to market and strategize the growth of tech-related stories and authors.
