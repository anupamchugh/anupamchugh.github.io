Video games are often thought of as a source of entertainment that provides no good value. Perhaps that’s how society sees it. Of course, playing games the whole day isn’t good for anyone.

But there’s a good side to it too which is often ignored. Specifically, for developers, video games can be a boon sometimes.

Developers tend to have rigorous working schedules and are under the pump, most of the time. Video games, in such cases, help in improving mental fitness. It’s like a workout session for the brain.

Let’s discuss a few perks that video games offer to a developer. Skills that you can translate to your work.

### It Sharpens Your Thinking Skills

Programming and video games have a lot of commonalities. For example, both require following a predefined set of rules to arrive at the solution.

Video games often force us into thinking our way around an obstacle. They do that a countless number of times. This boosts our lateral thinking which is often useful when finding new ideas to solve a complex algorithm or squashing a bug that isn’t really straightforward.

Another important aspect of thinking that video games help us to get better at is critical thinking.

Critical thinking requires you to make rational and logical decisions based on the facts presented to you.

While practicing code is the most obvious way of strengthening this skill, video games that are designed in the form of levels (that are interconnected) often encourage you to apply your critical thinking skills.

### It Improves Focus and Multi-Tasking

Programming is a mentally stimulating job. It requires a high degree of concentration. Certain video games, especially action ones like counter-strike, help achieve this as they require a good amount of attentiveness.

Having good attention skills goes a long way in improving a developer’s productivity and performance at work.

Playing a [video game for an hour](https://news.uark.edu/articles/40981/one-hour-of-video-gaming-can-increase-the-brain-s-ability-to-focus) can help in boosting your brain activity and improving focus.

Every developer has to deal with multitasking at some point. Video games ensure that you’re prepared to handle more than one task anytime. Be it a list of key combinations and objectives to keep in mind or fighting multiple enemies— multi-tasking is tested in almost all video games.

### It’s a Good Stress Buster and Promotes Thinking Out Loud

Software development is a mentally taxing job. Often, it requires you to work in a high-pressure environment. The immersive and engaging experience of video games lets you take a breather by escaping into a different reality.

The mental health benefits of video games extend deeper than people may realize. They’re intrinsically motivating and designed in a way to challenge you with each passing level which gives a sense of achievement. Regular playtime is good for restoring yourself and reduces workplace stress.

[Research proves](https://www.tamiu.edu/newsinfo/7-08-10/article5.shtml) how certain games make it easier to deal with stress, depression, and other mental health issues.

Besides, playing games promote thinking aloud. Thinking out loud is not only [good for stress relief](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04047-3) but also helps in finding clarity in one’s own thoughts.

Gamers tend to think aloud, especially when they're stuck in a mission. Today, a lot of technical interviewers encourage the candidates to do the same. It helps in evaluating the thought process and removes any scope of misinterpretation.

Video games are a good place to practice thinking out loud, especially if it doesn’t come naturally to you.

### It Fosters Team Building and Productivity

A product is the reflection of the team working on it. Every company aims to have efficient teams and a positive working atmosphere. To achieve that, they invest a lot in team-building activities (sports, weekly outings, and more).

While that’s all great, collaborative video games are [scientifically proven](https://aisel.aisnet.org/thci/vol10/iss4/2/) to boost team productivity and morale at the office.

It creates trust and gets the co-workers talking among themselves which can work wonders for newly formed teams.

Multiplayer games also require you to assume different roles and responsibilities at different times which helps you get better in coordination, leadership, and other team-based skills. Besides, it keeps the competitiveness spirit in you alive.

Offices today are happy to invest in dedicated gaming areas for socialization and relaxation purposes. It’s a good place for brainstorming new ideas or inadvertently solving a problem.

### Closing Thoughts

Video games are helpful to developers in other ways as well. They enhance our logical thinking, planning, and decision-making skills whilst also teaching us a thing or two about patience and perseverance.

While there are a lot of benefits to video games, indulging in it for long hours is considered harmful. It doesn’t really enhance your programming skills. Or teach you how to code.

Besides, it’s important to note that not being a gamer is no disadvantage by any means. There is no one-size-fits-all rule in software development and playing video games certainly does not determine the fate of a developer.

I hope the above benefits of video games will encourage you to try it out sometime and analyze its impact on your productivity at work. And again, if you’re not into games, it’s completely OK.
